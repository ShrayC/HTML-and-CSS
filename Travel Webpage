<h2>Sports (NHL):</h2>
<p id="sens">The Ottawa Senators (French: Sénateurs d'Ottawa) are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Senators play their home games at the 18,572 seat Canadian Tire Centre which opened in 1996 as the Palladium.

Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone, the team is the second NHL franchise to use the Ottawa Senators name. The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups and playing in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. On December 6, 1990, after a two-year public campaign by Firestone, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992–93 season. The current team owner is Eugene Melnyk, and in 2016, the franchise was valued by Forbes magazine at US$355 million.

The Senators have qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 15 of the past 19 seasons; have won four division titles and, in 2003, the Presidents' Trophy; and have appeared in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals. The club has been regularly represented in the top half in attendance in the NHL.</p>
